# Exercises
This is a repository that I am going to fill with programming exercises from various books.

Haskell:
	I am using the book "Learn you a Haskell" to learn the content needed to solve different problems in Haskell, but as this book does not provide exercises to work
	I am using exercises from the repository at https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises 
C: 
	For C I am using a book called Deep C Secrets.
